# TODO(richkadel): The target name is set differently compared to fuchsia.git's flutter_app().
# Unlike in fuchsia.git's version of fuchsia_component, the Fuchsia GN SDK
# version passes the component name to fuchsia_component via it's target_name only.
# GN SDK's fuchsia_component doesn't have a `component_name` argument! So I'm forced to set
# the component name via "target_name". This is a problem in fuchsia_package, which uses
# the target_name to name the fuchsia_pm_tool target, creating duplicate target IDs!
# So I have to change the fuchsia_package name to something that is NOT the component name,
# and then set the package_name (which fuchsia_package does support).
